Dataset Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned and prepared using Power Query Editor to ensure high-quality analysis.
Transformation: Relevant columns were transformed and optimized for better visualization performance.
2. Date Table Creation
Comprehensive Date Table: A Date table was created using DAX, incorporating fields such as Year, Quarter, Month, and Day of the Week. This allows for robust time-based analysis.
3. Visualizations
Total Streams & Track Count: Card visuals were used to display total streams, track count, and average streams per track, providing a quick snapshot of overall performance.
